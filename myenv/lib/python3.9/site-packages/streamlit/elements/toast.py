        .. warning::
            ``st.toast`` is not compatible with Streamlit's `caching \
            <https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching>`_ and
            cannot be called within a cached function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        body : str
            The string to display as Github-flavored Markdown. Syntax
            information can be found at: https://github.github.com/gfm.

            This also supports:

            * Emoji shortcodes, such as ``:+1:``  and ``:sunglasses:``.
              For a list of all supported codes,
              see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.

            * LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$"
              must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed
              at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.

            * Colored text, using the syntax ``:color[text to be colored]``,
              where ``color`` needs to be replaced with any of the following
              supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.
        icon : str or None
            An optional argument that specifies an emoji to use as
            the icon for the toast. Shortcodes are not allowed, please use a
            single character instead. E.g. "🚨", "🔥", "🤖", etc.
            Defaults to None, which means no icon is displayed.

        Example
        -------
        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>>
        >>> st.toast('Your edited image was saved!', icon='😍')
        """
        toast_proto = ToastProto()
        toast_proto.body = clean_text(validate_text(body))
        toast_proto.icon = validate_emoji(icon)
        return self.dg._enqueue("toast", toast_proto)

    @property
    def dg(self) -> "DeltaGenerator":
        """Get our DeltaGenerator."""
        return cast("DeltaGenerator", self)

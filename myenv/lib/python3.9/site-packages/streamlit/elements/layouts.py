        Inserts an invisible container into your app that can be used to hold
        multiple elements. This allows you to, for example, insert multiple
        elements into your app out of order.

        To add elements to the returned container, you can use "with" notation
        (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See
        examples below.

        Parameters
        ----------
        border : bool or None
            Whether to show a border around the container.


        Examples
        --------
        Inserting elements using "with" notation:

        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>>
        >>> with st.container():
        ...    st.write("This is inside the container")

        ...    st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(50, 3))
        ...

        Inserting elements out of order:

        >>> container = st.container(border=True)
        >>> container.write("This is inside the container")

        Inserts a number of multi-element containers laid out side-by-side and

        To add elements to the returned containers, you can use "with" notation

        Columns can only be placed inside other columns up to one level of nesting.

        .. warning::
            Columns cannot be placed inside other columns in the sidebar. This is only possible in the main area of the app.

        Parameters
        ----------
        spec : int or Iterable of numbers
            Controls the number and width of columns to insert. Can be one of:

            * An integer that specifies the number of columns. All columns have equal
              width in this case.
            * An Iterable of numbers (int or float) that specify the relative width of
              each column. E.g. ``[0.7, 0.3]`` creates two columns where the first
              one takes up 70% of the available with and the second one takes up 30%.
              Or ``[1, 2, 3]`` creates three columns where the second one is two times
              the width of the first one, and the third one is three times that width.

        gap : "small", "medium", or "large"
            The size of the gap between the columns. Defaults to "small".

        -------

        ----------
        tabs : list of str
            Creates a tab for each string in the list. The first tab is selected by default.
            The string is used as the name of the tab and can optionally contain Markdown,

        state : "running", "complete", or "error"
            The initial state of the status container which determines which icon is

        Returns

            A mutable status container that can hold multiple elements. The label, state,

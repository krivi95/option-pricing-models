class ScriptRunContext:
    """A context object that contains data for a "script run" - that is,
    data that's scoped to a single ScriptRunner execution (and therefore also
    scoped to a single connected "session").

    ScriptRunContext is used internally by virtually every `st.foo()` function.
    It is accessed only from the script thread that's created by ScriptRunner,
    or from app-created helper threads that have been "attached" to the
    ScriptRunContext via `add_script_run_ctx`.

    Streamlit code typically retrieves the active ScriptRunContext via the

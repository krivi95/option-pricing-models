"""
Note [Threading]
There are two kinds of threads in Streamlit, the main thread and script threads.
The main thread is started by invoking the Streamlit CLI, and bootstraps the
framework and runs the Tornado webserver.
A script thread is created by a ScriptRunner when it starts. The script thread
is where the ScriptRunner executes, including running the user script itself,
processing messages to/from the frontend, and all the Streamlit library function
calls in the user script.
It is possible for the user script to spawn its own threads, which could call
Streamlit functions. We restrict the ScriptRunner's execution control to the
script thread. Calling Streamlit functions from other threads is unlikely to
work correctly due to lack of ScriptRunContext, so we may add a guard against
it in the future.
